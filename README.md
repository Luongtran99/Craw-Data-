# Craw-Data-
Using C# and Regex

I had crawled data from website howkteam.com
This website can be changed or updated later, so you can update it then.
What you need is change regex pattern to correct pattern.
Hope it help for you.

What do you need to know about Regular expression and HttpClient
If you want to understand it clearly
, i will make a course to talk about regular expression and all about System.Net (what is useful for you to work with browser and website in your application)
